DATA
Window dimensions - Display
Spite dimensions - Game
Game textures - Display
Texture file names - Display
Player positions - Only need for respawning
Turret Positions - Don't really need
Map Sprite container - Display
Map grid - Display
Actions Info (movement, attack) - Managers
Game State Info (finished, respawn, score) - Managers
*Player position and rotation (Tracking Manager)
*Game runtime and Stopwatch (Game State Manager)
*Map texture, text, font size - Display

Other Notes:
Display can read the map and then pass the game sprite dimensions to game so that it can add the entities
GameData object will be created in game as a private variable, managers can only inherit some of the functions
Poll events and check keyboard input are a bit of a problem
addNewWolrdEnity should ideally be a manager
_sprites can be created in Display and passed to Game
